  {"id":"satoshinakamotoBitcoinPeertoPeerElectronic","abstract":"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.","author":[{"literal":"Satoshi Nakamoto"}],"citation-key":"satoshinakamotoBitcoinPeertoPeerElectronic","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"sosiCooperationCommuneLongevity2003","abstract":"The costly signaling theory of religion posits that religious rituals and taboos can promote intragroup cooperation, which is argued to be the primary adaptive benefit of religion. To test this theory, the authors collected historical data on the constraints and ritual requirements that eighty-three 19th-century U.S. communes imposed on their members. All communes must solve the collective action problem of cooperative labor to survive; thus, they are an ideal population to assess the impact of ritual and taboo on intragroup cooperation. The authors evaluated whether communes that imposed costlier requirements survived longer than less demanding communes and whether costly requirements and religiosity interact to promote cooperation. The results support aspects of the costly signaling theory of religion and reveal new avenues for its development. The authors discuss some of the shortcomings of the theory and explore ways to expand the theory that incorporate additional features of ritual and religious belief.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Sosi","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Bressler","given":"Eric R."}],"citation-key":"sosiCooperationCommuneLongevity2003","container-title":"Cross-Cultural Research","container-title-short":"Cross-Cultural Research","DOI":"10.1177/1069397103037002003","ISSN":"1069-3971, 1552-3578","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",5]]},"language":"en","license":"https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","page":"211-239","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cooperation and Commune Longevity: A Test of the Costly Signaling Theory of Religion","title-short":"Cooperation and Commune Longevity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1069397103037002003","volume":"37"},
